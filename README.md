# Split with New File

This is a Visual Studio Code extension that overrides the default behavior of the split editor commands to open new untitled files instead of showing the active file.

## Features

-   When the `workbench.action.splitEditor` command is used, a new untitled file is created and displayed in the editor to the right of the active editor.
-   When the `workbench.action.splitEditorDown`, `workbench.action.splitEditorUp`, `workbench.action.splitEditorLeft`, or `workbench.action.splitEditorRight` commands are used, a new untitled file is created and displayed in a new editor group in the specified direction.

## Requirements

Visual Studio Code version 1.46.0 or higher.

## Installation

You can install the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yourusername.splitwithnewfile), or by searching for "Split with New File" in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).

## Usage

After installing the extension, simply use the split editor commands (`Ctrl+\` or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+\` by default) as you normally would. The new untitled file will be created and displayed automatically.
